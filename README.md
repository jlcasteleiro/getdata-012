# Project for the "Getting and cleaning data" course from Coursera

The project is perform by the script <run_analysis.R>
The script should be run inside the folder in which the file from the course was unzip (and create the folder "UCI HAR Dataset"). This should be the working directory. The script go inside this folder and read the data from the diferent files in the diferent folders.

The project is based in a unique script, and the output (the tidy data achieved) is write in a file named "Project_getdata-012_Casteleiro.txt".

As the data is part of an external research, some important links are the next:
